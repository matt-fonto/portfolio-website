            I am a lifelong learner who has founded his own English academy and
            managed his own team, yet decided to pursue a life-long passion for
            computer science, software development, and coding. Iâ€™m a highly
            driven and focused individual, who seeks to help people and society,
            be it through education, be it through technological solutions.
